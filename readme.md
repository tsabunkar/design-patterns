# Design Patterns :

- These are typical solution to common problems in software design.
- Each design pattern is like a blueprint to solve a particular design problem.
- The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.
- Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems
- While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution.
- NOTE : The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

# Why should I learn patterns ?

- Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design.
- knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.
- Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently.

# Classification of Design patterns :

- The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms.
- The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns.
- 3 patterns :
  - Creational patterns
  - Structural patterns
  - Behavioral patterns
- Creational patterns : provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Structural patterns : explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
- Behavioral patterns : take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

# Creational patterns

- provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Different Creational patterns are :
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Method
  - Builder
  - Prototype
  - Singleton

---

# Structural patterns

- explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
- Different Structural patterns are :
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy

---

# Behavioral patterns

- take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- Behavioral Structural patterns are :
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor
