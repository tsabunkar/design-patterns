# Factory Design Pattern

- In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to client and the client use the same common interface to create new type of object.
- Identification: Factory methods can be recognized by creation methods, which create objects from concrete classes, but return them as objects of abstract type or interface.
