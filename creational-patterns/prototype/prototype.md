# Motivation of Prototype Design Pattern

- Complicated objects (ex- cars) aren't designed from scratch
  - They reiterate existing designs
- An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a prototype.
- We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
  - Requires 'deep copy' support.
- We make the cloning convient (ex- via a Factory).
